_________TERMINOLOGY___________
A graph consists of nodes and edges. In this book, the variable n denotes the
number of nodes in a graph, and the variable m denotes the number of edges

E.g. 1 <--> 2 <--> 5
     /\
     | |
     |  |
     v    v
     3 <--> 4
the <--> mean that the graph can be traversed from node 3 - node 1 / node 1 - node 3
this graph has 5 nodes and 4 edges

The nodes are numbered using integers 1,2,...,n

A path leads from node a to node b through edges of the graph. The length
of a path is the number of edges in it. 

A path is a cycle if the first and last node is the same
A path is simple if each node appears at most once in the path.

_________________CONNECTIVITY_______________
A graph is connected if there is a path between any two nodes
The connected parts of a graph are called its components. 
any node is reachable from any other node by traversing one or more edges.

(LOOK at connected_component.png), nodes 4 and 5 form a connected connected_component

A tree is a connected graph that consists of n nodes and n−1 edges. There is a unique path between any two nodes of a tree

________EDGE DIRECTIONS______________________
A graph is directed if the edges can be traversed in one direction only
(LOOK AT directed_graph.png for example graph)

In a directed graph, the indegree of a node is the number of edges that end
at the node, and the outdegree of a node is the number of edges that start at
the node. 

in the directed_graph.png, the value of the indegree for node 2 is 1, and the outdegree is 2.

______EDGE WEIGHTS_____
In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths
(LOOK at weighted_graph.png for example)

_________NEIGHBORS AND DEGREES_________
Two nodes are neighbors or adjacent if there is an edge between them. The
degree of a node is the number of its neighbors.

The sum of degrees in a graph is always 2m, where m is the number of edges, because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one. 
For this reason, the sum of degrees is always even

A graph is regular if the degree of every node is a constant d. A graph is complete 
if the degree of every node is n−1, i.e., the graph contains all possible edges between the nodes

_______COLORINGS______________
In a coloring of a graph, each node is assigned a color so that no adjacent nodes
have the same color.

A graph is bipartite if it is possible to color it using two colors. It turns out
that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not contain a cycle with an odd
number of edges

(LOOk at colorings.png) for reference

__MISC__
in (weird_graph.png), the loops between nodes 2 and 3 mean that they are 2 undirected edges between nodes 2 and 3
that feature adds more ways to traverse the graph
