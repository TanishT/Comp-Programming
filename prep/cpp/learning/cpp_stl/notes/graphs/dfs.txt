algo for traversing a graph (exploring all possible connected elements in a particular graph)
starts at a root node (parameter to function)
for there, it will choose an element from the root node's adj_list
this executes recursively, if a particular node has already been visited, the algo backtracks to a node that still adj_list elements that have not been explored
